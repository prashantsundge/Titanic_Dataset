# TITANIC MACHINE LEARNING FROM DISASTER

## Introduction

This repository contains code and resources for a machine learning project aimed at predicting passenger survival on the Titanic. The project is based on the "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster" competition on Kaggle.

## The Challenge

The challenge is to build and train machine learning models to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features. This is a classic binary classification problem.

## Data Overview

### Dataset Description

The dataset consists of two main files:
- `train.csv`: This file is used for training the models and contains information about a subset of passengers along with their survival status.
- `test.csv`: This file is used to evaluate the models and contains passenger information without survival status.

### Overview

The dataset contains various features such as passenger class, name, sex, age, number of siblings/spouses aboard, number of parents/children aboard, ticket number, fare, cabin, and port of embarkation.

### Data Dictionary

For a detailed description of the dataset's variables, please refer to the [Data Dictionary](data_dictionary.md).

### Variable Notes

For additional notes on specific variables in the dataset, consult the [Variable Notes](variable_notes.md).

## Import Library

This section describes the Python libraries used in the project. Key libraries include NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and more. These libraries are essential for data manipulation, visualization, and model building.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is crucial to understand the dataset better. This section explores statistical summaries, data visualizations, and insights gained from the EDA process.

## Train-Test Split

Before training any machine learning models, it's important to split the data into training and testing subsets. This section explains the process of splitting the data for model development and evaluation.

## Standard Scaler

Standard scaling is often used to preprocess numerical features. This section details the application of the Standard Scaler to ensure that numerical features are on the same scale.

## Naive Bayes Model

This section presents the implementation of a Naive Bayes classification model. It provides details on training and evaluating the model, including metrics such as accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.

## Decision Tree

A decision tree model is a popular choice for classification tasks. This section explains the development and evaluation of a decision tree model, along with key metrics.

## Random Forest Model

Random Forest is an ensemble learning method. This section showcases the creation and evaluation of a Random Forest model, including accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.

## Working on Test Dataset to Predict

The test dataset is used to make predictions using the trained models. This section covers the process of applying the models to the test dataset and generating predictions.
